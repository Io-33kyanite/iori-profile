abstract: 'This study proposes a method for generating geofences driven by GPS trajectory
  data to realize scalable point-of-interest (POI) notifiers, encouraging walking
  tourists to discover new local spots. The case study revealed that manual geofence
  settings degrade the location relevance and user coverage—key objectives of POI
  notifiers—and hinder the scalability and reliability of services. The formalization
  presented computationally equips geofence designers with practical solutions through
  two implementations based on prior GPS trajectory logs: (1) a multiobjective genetic
  algorithm that suggests cost-effective geofences by providing trade-off visualizations
  and (2) a user coverage-penalized genetic algorithm that determines an optimal geofence
  based on the designers’ expectations. The feasibility and stability of the proposed
  implementations were tested in areas with varying tourist flow patterns. A comparative
  survey among manual settings, settings incorporating a reliability simulation, and
  data-driven settings demonstrates significant performance improvements for geofence
  services.'
